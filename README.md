# ReverseScroll

**ReverseScroll** is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that reverses the mouse scroll direction while keeping trackpad scrolling unchanged.

## Features

- **Selective Scroll Reversal**: Only reverses mouse scrolling, leaving trackpad scrolling as is.
- **Easy Menu Bar Access**: Quick access with an option to quit easily.
- **Lightweight**: Uses just 20 MB of memory.
- **Open Source**: Available for download or self-build.

## Installation

1. [Download the app](https://github.com/wooii/ReverseScroll/releases/download/v0.2/ReverseScroll.zip).

2. Unzip the file, move the app to your **Applications** folder, and launch it.

3. **Allow App Execution**:
   - On first launch, macOS will block the app since it's unsigned. To bypass:
     - Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Security**.
     - Select **Open Anyway** next to the ReverseScroll alert.
   - Relaunch the app; it will request Accessibility Permissions. Grant permissions within 10 seconds, or the app will close automatically.

4. To start ReverseScroll automatically at login:
   - Go to **System Settings** > **General** > **Login Items & Extensions**.
   - Click **+** and add ReverseScroll from the **Applications** folder.
