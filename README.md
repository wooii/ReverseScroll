# ReverseScroll

**ReverseScroll** is a macOS menu bar app that reverses mouse scroll direction while keeping trackpad scrolling unaffected.

## Features

- **Selective Scroll Reversal**: Reverses scrolling for the mouse only, leaving trackpad settings unchanged.
- **Minimal Design**: Simple, menu bar access with an option to quit.
- **Lightweight**: Uses under 20 MB of memory.
- **Open Source**: Free to download and self-compilation.

## Installation

1. **[Download the app](https://github.com/wooii/ReverseScroll/releases/download/v0.3/ReverseScroll.zip)**.

2. Unzip the file, move the app to your **Applications** folder, and launch it.

3. **Enable App Execution**:
   - On first launch, macOS may block the app as itâ€™s unsigned. To allow it:
     - Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Security**.
     - Click **Open Anyway** next to the ReverseScroll warning.
   - Relaunch the app, and it will prompt for Accessibility Permissions. Grant permissions within 10 seconds, or the app will close automatically.
   - After granting Accessibility Permissions, the app will add itself to **Login Items** for automatic startup at login.
