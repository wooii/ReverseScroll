# ReverseScroll

**ReverseScroll** is a macOS menu bar app that reverses scroll direction for the mouse while leaving the trackpad unaffected.

## Features
- **Mouse Scroll Reversal**: Alters mouse scroll direction only, keeping trackpad behavior unchanged.
- **Menu Bar Access**: Easy access with a quick quit option.
- **Lightweight**: Consumes only 20 MB of memory.
- **Open Source**: Download or build it yourself.

## Installation
1. [Download the app](https://github.com/wooii/ReverseScroll/releases/download/v0.1/ReverseScroll.App.zip).
2. Move it to your **Applications** folder and launch it.
3. When running it for the first time, macOS will block it since the app isn't signed with a developer account (I don't have one, it costs $99 per year). To bypass this:
   - Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
   - Try reopening the app.

4. **Optional**: To have the app start at login or restart:
   - Go to **System Settings** > **General** > **Login Items & Extensions**.
   - Click the **+** sign, then add ReverseScroll from the **Applications** folder.
