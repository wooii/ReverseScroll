# ReverseScroll

**ReverseScroll** is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that reverses the scroll direction for your mouse while keeping the trackpad behavior unchanged.

## Features

- **Selective Scroll Reversal**: Only affects mouse scroll direction, leaving trackpad scrolling unchanged.
- **Convenient Menu Bar Access**: Simple interface with a quick quit option.
- **Lightweight**: Uses just 20 MB of memory.
- **Open Source**: Available for download or you can build it yourself.

## Installation

1. [Download the app from releases](https://github.com/wooii/ReverseScroll/releases/download/v0.1/ReverseScroll.App.zip).

2. Unzip the downloaded file and move the app to your **Applications** folder and launch it.

3. **Allow App Execution**:
   - On first launch, macOS will block the app since it's not signed with a developer account (I don't have one, it costs $99 per year). To bypass this:
     - Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Security**.
     - Click **Open Anyway** next to the ReverseScroll alert.
   - Relaunch the app and it will ask for Accessibility Permissions:
     - Allow the accessibility. 
   - Relaunch the app and enjoy.

4. **Optional**: To have ReverseScroll start automatically at login:
   - Go to **System Settings** > **General** > **Login Items & Extensions**.
   - Click the **+** button and add ReverseScroll from the **Applications** folder.
